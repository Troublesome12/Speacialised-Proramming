Practice problem/Exam and number: RugSizes, PartySeats
Week: 3

*******************
* Description *
*******************
1. List the problems you attempted, and Java API Classes and methods you used to
solve each problem.
[Eg. SlowKeyBoard: ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort]

Problem1: RugSizes
- Java Classes: ArrayList (add, size, get) – to store factors.
- Main Idea: Basic arithmetic operations and loops.

Problem2: PartySeats
- Java Classes: ArrayList (add, get, size) – to store boy and girl names, java.util.Collections.sort – to sort names alphabetically.
- Main Idea: Basic loops and string operations.

*******************
* Challenges *
*******************
RugSizes:
- Understanding the conditions for rug dimensions - either atleast one odd side or both sides are equal.
- Avoiding duplicate counting for similar dimensions (Eg. 5*6 and 6*5).

PartySeats:
- Ensuring the seating alternates between boys and girls correctly.
- Handling odd/even count differences that make seating impossible.

************************
* Solution Approach *
************************
3. Approach:
RugSizes:
- Loop through possible factors of the given area.
- Check if the conditions are satisfied or not.
- Count only unique configurations.

PartySeats:
- Separate boys and girls into different lists.
- Sort each list alphabetically.
- Arrange them alternately starting with a girl, ensuring no rules are violated.

4. What did you learn from the problem?
- RugSizes: Learned how to handle constraints in problems.
- PartySeats: Using ArrayList and Collections.sort for dynamic data handling.

5. Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic design, coding)?  
- Algorithmic design and constraint handling.
- Clean and efficient Java implementation.

6. What are your goals for the next practice problems? 
- Further reduce algorithmic complexity where possible.
- Practice more list manipulation and sorting challenges. 
- Will start a solution with Brute Force and leter will try to improve with appropriate algorithm.

7. Have you used any AI tool such as ChatGPT? How have you used it and explain this tool is helping you to be a better problem solver?  
- Yes, I used ChatGPT just to know how can I sort a list, as I'm new in Java I didn't know that I can sort using Collection.
